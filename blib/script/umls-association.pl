=head1 NAME

umls-association.pl This program calculates the assocation between 
two concepts or sets of concepts

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This utility takes two sets of concepts and returns their assocation 
score

=head1 USAGE

Usage: umls-assocation.pl [OPTIONS] CUI_set1 CUI_set2 --matrix Matrix_File --measure Assoc_Measure

=head1 INPUT

=head2 [CUI_set1] [CUI_set2] 

Two sets of CUIs in the UMLS. Each CUI in the CUI set is comma seperated

[Matrix_File]

File name containing co-occurrence data in sparse matrix format

[Assoc_Measure]

A string specifying the association measure to use
The measure used to calculate the assocation. Recommended = x2 

The package uses the Text::NSP package to do the calculation. 
The measure included within this package are: 
    
    1.  Dice Coefficient
    2.  Fishers exact test - left sided
    3.  Fishers exact test - right sided
    4.  Fishers twotailed test - right sided
    5.  Jaccard Coefficient
    6.  Log-likelihood ratio
    7.  Mutual Information
    8.  Odds Ratio
    9.  Pointwise Mutual Information
    10. Phi Coefficient
    11. Pearson's Chi Squared Test
    12. Poisson Stirling Measure
    13. T-score

=head1 OPTIONS

Optional command line arguements

=head2 General Options:

Displays the quick summary of program options.

=head3 --noorder

If selected, the order in which CUIs appear will be disregarded when 
the association score is calculated.

=head3 --lta

Linking Term Association - Calculates the association scores using 
implicit or intermediate relationships between the specified CUIs,
and the count of unique shared co-occurrences.

=head3 --mwa

Minimum Weight Association - Calculates the association scores using 
implicit or intermediate relationships between the specified CUIs, 
and the minimum co-occurrence count between shared co-occurrences.

=head3 --lsa

Linking Set Association - Calculates the association scores using the
association between the sets of co-occurring terms of the original terms

=head3 --sbc

Shared B to C association - Calculates the association scores using
the association between the set of A co-occuring terms, and the 
term C. 

=head3 --wsa

Weighted Set Association - Same as linking set association, but weights
the members of the linking set based on their association with the original
term. The association measure used for weighting is the same as specified
for quantifying association overall (--measure)

=head3 --nonorm

Indicates that the weights in WSA will NOT be normalized between 0 and 1
and instrad the direct association score will be used

=head3 --precision N

Displays values up to N places of decimal. (DEFAULT: 4)
    

=head3 --help

Displays the quick summary of program options.

=head3 --version

Displays the version information.


=head1 OUTPUT

The association between the two concepts (or terms)
